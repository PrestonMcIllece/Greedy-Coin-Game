Game played vs CPU to see who can accumulate more points. This program uses LinkedLists to keep track of the coins. Picture the coins as being laid out in a horizontal row.
When it is your turn, you can either pick the left-most coin or the right-most coin. If the rules are followed correctly, CPU will win every time.
